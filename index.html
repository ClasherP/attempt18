        <h2>📜 Background</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in <strong>Hampshire, UK</strong> 🌿, with family roots stretching all the way to 
        <em>New Zealand</em> 🇳🇿 and <em>St Lucia</em> 🌴 in the Caribbean.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I studied at <strong>Salesian College Farnborough</strong>, where I achieved 9 GCSEs 📚 with grades ranging from 5 (B) to 8 (A*).  
        I then attended <strong>Salesian College Sixth Form</strong>, completing A, A, and B in A Levels, 
        including <strong>Computer Science</strong> 💻 which i am now persuing at university.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I’m now studying <strong>BSc Computer Science</strong> at the University of Reading 🎓, 
        where I’ve achieved a <strong>First</strong> throughout my first year.  
        My academic interests lean heavily towards emerging technologies, especially 
        <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> 🥽, which fascinates me with its potential to 
        transform industries and redefine how we experience the world.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I’m 19 and enjoy a mix of activities that keep me thinking and moving.  
        I’m an enthusiastic <strong>rock climber</strong> 🧗, a competitive <strong>chess player</strong> ♟️, 
        and a casual <strong>skateboarder</strong> 🛹.  
        In my downtime, I love gaming 🎮 and piano. My favourite video game title of all time is <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, and my favourite piano piece is a clair de lune
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe in always pushing myself to learn, create, and connect whether that’s through 
        my studies, hobbies, or meeting new people from around the world 🌍.
      </p>

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>
        <h3>Visualising Shortest Path Algorithms with Python</h3>
        <p>
            This was my first real world project. Aiming to help my computer science teacher teach the pathfinding algorithms topic in my A-levels, I developed a fully
             interactive graph visualiser where you can create your own custom graphs and run multiple pathfinding algorithms on them. 
        </p>
        <p>A visual implementation was key to help his students 
             understand how algorithms like Dijkstra/A* work. All code and resources are fully open-source, making it easy for others to explore, adapt, or build upon my work.
              Scroll down to the links section below to access the public git hub repository with the source code and the 100+ development write up.</p>
            
        <h3>three.js portfolio website</h3>
        <p>
            You're looking at the finished product. I was experimenting with Three.js, a 3d web development too, and wanted to make a unique portfolio website to showcase my achivements and my web development skills. I plan to use other technologies like react to redesign this in the future.
        </p>

        <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Current project:</span> Visualising Shortest Path Algorithms with Javascript </h3>
        <p>
            Looking back my python Visualising Shortest Path Algorithms project, i realises one of the main problems was that it was difficult to access. Redeveloping this entierly with javascript would make it much more accessible while boosting performance.
        </p>
        <p>I plan to upload it to this website in the comming months!</p>
